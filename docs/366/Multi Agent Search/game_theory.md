## Dominance
The idea of dominance is to do with the selection of a strategy based on the
its outcome versus the other players strategies. If a strategy is always better
than another strategy, then it is said to strictly dominate that strategy. If
it is sometimes better, then it is said to weakly dominate that strategy.

## Best Response
When dominance isn't found in the strategies we next look at best response.
The player selects the stragegy that maximises their utility given the other
players strategy. 

## Nash Equilibrium
A nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies where no player has an incentive to
change their strategy. It's easiest identified by looking at the best response
for each player. If they are both playing their best response in a given cell
then it is a nash equilibrium.

## Mixed Strategy
A pure strategy is one that we can find from playing a single strategy, but 
a nash equilibrium may not exist. Instead we have to take a mix of strategies 
to find a nash equilibrium.
