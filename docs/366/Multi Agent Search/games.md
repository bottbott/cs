Multi agent games can be represented in different ways. Two of the ways we will
look at are: 

- Normal-Form Game
- Extensive-Form Game

## Normal-Form Game
This represents the game in a grid where each cell represents the utility of 
the players. One player is the "row player", and the other player is the 
"column player". The actions that each player can take are above or beside the
column/row. 

## Extensive-Form Game
Games are represented as a tree of decisions. Each node represents some 
configuration of the game where the agent must act. 


## Information
Agents in multi player games may have **perfect** or **imperfect information**.
Perfect information is when all players know the state of the game, and this
would be seen in a game of chess where both players can see the board.
Imperfect information is when players don't know the full state of the game,
and this would be found in a game of poker.
