In the Informed Search section we looked at Conflict Based Search and 
Cooperative A* which are examples of multi-agent search algorithms. However
they differ from the algorithms in this section as they have central control
where each agent isn't reasoning individually about how to act. Here the agents
are reasoning individually. 

To reason about how agents should make decisions, we have some concepts from
Game Theory that we discuss.
