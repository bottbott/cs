There are several properties of search algorithms that are of interest to us. 

## Complete
For an algorithm to be complete, it must always be able to find a solution if
a solution exists for a problem. 

## Optimal
An algorithm may find many candidate solutions to a problem, but it must be 
able to determine which one is the best of all the possible solutions. We are
often looking for the presence of the shortest path, and an optimal algorithm
will find it. 

Suboptimal algorithms will be useful to us when an optimal algorithm exists, 
but its implementation is too costly. 

## Space Complexity


## Time Complexity
