## Operators

### ... spread

The spread operator takes an iterator (such as a string or array), and lets us expand it into individual elements where we can use it in a function that expects zero or more arguments, or where elements are expected.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const newNumbers = [...numbers, 4];
console.log(newNumbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
