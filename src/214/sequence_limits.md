# Limits

In the past we have considered limits for functions as the input
approaches some finite or infinite value. Does the limit exist? If it
does, what is the value?

The exploration of the limit gives us information about where the terms
of the sequence are tending towards. Do they move towards the same
value? Or do they not move towards the same value?

Sequences that move towards a limit demonstrate **convergence**, and
those that do not are divergent.
